Module: Helpers.Input
Description: Helper functions to make parsing input easier.

Chiefly concerned with chunking up the input in a way that frees you from
having to directly confront monadic composition until you're ready.  You
will see "Monad" sprinkled about in this documentation, but you don't need
to understand it.  Wherever you see "Monad" you can just substitute the
"Result" type.

module Helpers.Input where

{- |
This will break up the input a line at a time and run your parser against each
line in turn.  Use this method if your parsing is guaranteed, such as if
each line is a name or something.  If there's any error possible, return an
Either String a and use `lineByLineM` instead.
-}
lineByLine :: (String -> a) -- ^ A parser for a single line of input
    -> String               -- ^ You will not provide this, the framework will, it is input
    -> [a]
lineByLine f = map f . lines

{- |
  Monadic version of lineByLine.  It will also run your parser against each
  line, but it will gather it into a big Result at the end, which is
  necessary for the adventOfCode family of functions.
-}
lineByLineM :: Monad m
    => (String -> m a) -- ^ Your parser, which returns a Result
    -> String
    -> m [a]
lineByLineM f = sequence . lineByLine f

{- |
This will break up the input a character at time and run your parser against each
character.  This is the guaranteed version.  It is possible to compose this with
`lineByLine` to get a two dimensional list of characters run through your parser:

@
    lineByLine . charByChar $ someParser
@
-}
charByChar :: (Char -> a) -- ^ A Parser for a single Character
    -> String
    -> [a]
charByChar = map 

{- |
Monadic version of charByChar.  Like lineByLineM, it gathers all your results
into a single big one.   Also composable like charByChar:

@
    lineByLineM . charByCharM $ someParser
@
-}
charByCharM :: Monad m
    => (Char -> m a) -- ^ A Parser for a single character, which returns a Result
    -> String
    -> m [a]
charByCharM = mapM

{-|
Strip the newlines from an input.  Very useful if input is a single line.
-}
stripNewLines :: String -> String
stripNewLines = filter (/='\n')
